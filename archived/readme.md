# Astrophotography image processing

## Design for computerized telescope

* Feedback on how well calibration is working - histograms, variation in noise post-stacking, etc.
* Dewpoint predictor and warnings
* Temperature monitoring and auto-cooling
* Temperature monitoring and automatic recalibration - taking add'l dark frames as temperature changes
* Automatic dithering
* (?) Built-in flat frame light source - moving or refocusing the instrument can alter incoming light
* ... alternatively, do twilight / sky frames
