# Astrophotography image processing

## Curriculum

1. Introduction to astrophotography: Learn the basics of astrophotography, including the equipment used, camera settings, and exposure times.
2. Image acquisition: Learn how to capture images of the night sky using a digital camera or a telescope.
3. Image calibration: Learn how to process raw astronomical images, including dark frame subtraction, flat field correction, and bias correction.
4. Image stacking: Learn how to combine multiple images to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and produce a final image with greater detail.
   1. Registration: Learn how to align and register multiple images to be stacked, including techniques for eliminating field rotation, field curvature, and focal plane distortion.
   2. Methods: Learn about different image stacking methods, including average stacking, median stacking, and sigma clipping.
   3. Settings: Learn how to adjust image stacking settings to produce the best final image, including choosing the right number of images to stack and the best stacking method.
   4. Post-processing: Learn how to post-process the final stacked image using techniques such as histogram stretching, noise reduction, and sharpening.
5. Image enhancement: Learn how to process and enhance final images using techniques such as histogram stretching, noise reduction, and sharpening.
6. Color processing: Learn how to create a color image from a set of monochrome images captured through different filters.
7. Advanced techniques: Learn about advanced techniques such as luminance layering, layer masks, and star tracking for capturing sharp images of the night sky.
8. Image analysis: Learn how to analyze astrophotographic images to extract scientific information, such as determining the position and brightness of stars, the size of galaxies, and the presence of nebulae.
